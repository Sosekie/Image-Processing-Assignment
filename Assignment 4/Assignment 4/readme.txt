# Description of My Algorithm:

How I get the same input and output size:

Here I write a padding function, I also tested both zero padding and edge padding, and visualized both of them. You can see my code for details.

A short description of my gradient filter and the Laplacian of Gaussian filter:

Here I use the Prewitt and Sobel Filters as my gradient filter, the idea of this is to change the direction of "vector" in horizental or vertical, and get the kernel to handle image.

Laplacian of Gaussian filter is a combination of Gaussian and Laplacian, since Laplacian filters are very sensitive to noise, so Gaussian smoothing filter first reduce the noise, and then we do a second derivative of neighbour pixel.

The responses to the questions 1. c), 2. d) et 3. c).

I wrote answers in ipynb, you can look at my code while combining the results of my visualisation to get a better feel for the description of my answer.
